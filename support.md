## Get support

We provide support using the [GGUS](https://ggus.eu/) portal
operated by [EGI](http://www.egi.eu/).

## Issue tracker

Developments and issues used to be tracked in the [INFN JIRA issue tracking service][VOMS-jira], but now they are tracked in the corresponding Github projects:

- [VOMS server, C/C++ APIs and clients][voms]
- [VOMS-Admin server][voms-admin]
- [VOMS Java APIs][voms-api-java]
- [VOMS Java clients][voms-java-clients]

Note that VOMS-Admin serve is not developed anymore and there is very minimal support for it until the end of 2024.
